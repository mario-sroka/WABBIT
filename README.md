# WABBIT - RNS (reactive navier stokes physics)
## (W)avelet (A)daptive (B)lock-(B)ased solver for (I)nteractions with (T)urbulence

WABBIT-RNS is a fork from WABBIT, to implement separatly reactive navier stokes physics and other things. Due to heavy changes in some of the core routines, a merge with the WABBIT master branch would not be an easy task. But someday WABBIT-RNS will be synchronized again with the master.

New in comparison to WABBIT are:

+ reactive navier stokes physics
+ turbulence forcing
